This guide contains every sources, methods, schematics I used and created in this project. Following them you should be able to create the same project I made !

## Requirements for disassembly

1. RTIC Minitel 1 (*)
2. Soldering iron.
3. Isopropyl alcohol.
4. Philips cross-head screwdrivers.

(*: The minitel 1 version I am using is the French Azerty Minitel from RTIC with the "keyboard in drawer". So unlike the rotating screen covering keyboard version where connections between the power circuit card and motherboard are made with a 7-pins ribbon, in my case this is a 8-pins ribbon. Nevertheless if you use a 7-pins one that should not be a problem I guess ! :man_shrugging:)
