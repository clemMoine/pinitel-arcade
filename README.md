Minitel with Raspberry Pi integration project

This repository contains every sources I used in this project. Following them you should be able to create the same project I made !

## Requirements for disassembly

1. Minitel 1 (*)
2. Soldering iron.
3. Isopropyl alcohol.
4. Philips cross-head screwdrivers.
5. At least two thin flat screwdrivers.
6. Some ears q-tips or any dry cleaning stuff.

(*: The minitel 1 version I used was the French Azerty Minitel with the "keyboard in drawer" not the rotating and screen covering one so the connections are a bit different since I had a 8pins ribbon and the rotating keyboard one is 7pins connector but that should not be a problem I guess.)
